Code written to help solve tasks in the reptile database and protein abundance projects

The scripts and what they do will be added below

SCRIPTS for gecko book belwo

DeleteRepeatSequences 
- this file goes through the database file and removes duplicates for synonyms of all the geckos. it keeps only the oldest recorded use of each synonym. this is then output to a text file

Holotyping problem
- this problem shortening holotyping data for each species in the database. At the time chatGTP was all the rage, so I made regular expressions using chat GPT's help as a 'fun' experiment It worked well and the code is the result.

OrthologAbundanceCalculation
- this was part of an experiment testing abundance data of specific protein complexes and their orthologs using the eggNOG database and paxDB. the following scripts in there were used but also required some stuff done by hand to the excel sheets in between runs.
